ObjHunt
=========

A new and improved Garry's Mod prop hunt

###Install guide

* You will need a [Garry's Mod Dedicated Server]
* Set up your config files to run ObjHunt in garrysmod/cfg/ *( these are mine as an example )*
    * [server.cfg]
    * [autoexec.cfg]
    * [mount.cfg]
* Lastly you clone this repository into garrysmod/gamemodes/prop_hunt


The game now runs under the Prop Hunt tab in the server browser so look there for your servers!

###Adding taunts
* Take a look at sh_config.lua and the content/sound/taunts/ directory.
